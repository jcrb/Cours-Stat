This set of slides is for our [presentation](http://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/18923) at [R 2013 Lyon](http://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/). It covers some salient aspects of the course stored in the [ida](..) repository. It's a 6-minute flash talk, so don't expect too much out of it, but feel free to email about the course if you have questions!
