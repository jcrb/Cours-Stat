This course is an introduction to analyzing data with the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) software. It features some mathematics and statistics as well as some statistical computing and data visualization. You will need a laptop with an Internet connection to follow the class.

To get started, [download the entire course](https://github.com/briatte/ida/archive/master.zip). To take a look at what the course material is made of, [view it on GitHub first](https://github.com/briatte/ida). It's not a large download.
