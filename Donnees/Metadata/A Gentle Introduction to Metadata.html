<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<i>Metadata</i> is a new word based on an old concept.
Any summary of the contents of a library or archive, like
a card catalog, contains metadata. It is the preferred term of the technical community
to refer to ``card-catalog'' data, and it will, therefore, become
increasingly used as more technical tools are developed for linguistic
research. The purpose
of this document is to provide a non-technical introduction describing
what metadata is, what the general linguist should know about
it, and also to describe some aspects of the metadata standard
used by the <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/">Open Language Archives Community</a> (OLAC).



<h2><a name="Whatitis"></a>2. What metadata is</h2>

<p align="justify">
There is little conceptually new about metadata. The shortest definition
for the term is ``data about data,'' and, while many of us may not be
accustomed to thinking about metadata very much, we create it and make use
of it all the time. A citation like the one below, is a form of metadata:
</p>


<p align="justify">
Bloomfield, Leonard. 1933. <i>Language</i>. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The reference above is information about a book--that is, data about data.
</p>


<p align="justify">
Something important to note about a reference like the one above
is that we understand the information it is trying to convey by convention.
The first element is the author's name, then the year, then the title,
then the city and publisher. Also, our knowledge of the basic structure
of references allows us to be fairly sure this citation refers to
a book.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Another way of representing the metadata in the above reference
would be as follows:
</p>


<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><b>Document type</b></td> <td>Book</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Last name of author</b></td> <td>Bloomfield</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>First name of auther&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td> <td>Leonard</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Year of publication</b></td> <td>1933</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Title</b></td> <td>Language</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>City</b></td> <td>New York</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Publisher</b></td> <td>Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p align="justify">
The standard citation and the above table are both different representations
of the same metadata. The table has the advantage of explicitly marking
the category of information encoded in the various pieces of the citation.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A book citation is a fairly well-known kind of metadata, but the general
idea of ``data about data'' is far more inclusive. An annotated bibliography, for example,
also constitutes metadata which is very much like a list of references except
that it also includes an extra level of description in addition to the basic
metadata for the document.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Though they do not match the traditional notion of ``data type'', it's also
easy to find metadata about linguistic software, which can often be quite
valuable. Below is metadata about the SIL Shoebox field linguist's tool.
</p>

<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><b>Name</b></td>  <td>The Linguist's Shoebox</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Platform(s)</b></td>  <td>Windows (3.1, 95/98, NT), Macintosh (OS 6, OS 7, 68K, PPC)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Categories</b></td> <td>data management, parser, text analysis</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Domains</b></td> <td>morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon/dictionary</td>

	<tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Description</b></td> <td>Shoebox is a computer program that 
helps field linguists and anthropologists integrate various kinds of 
text data: lexical, cultural, grammatical, etc. It has flexible options

</tbody></table>

<p align="justify">
One can make metadata for any linguistic resource--there could even be metadata
about metadata. For example, a description of a collection of bibliographies
would be data about data about data (a.k.a. meta-metadata).
</p>

<p align="justify">
It's also fairly common to include the metadata about a linguistic resource
within the resource itself. The title page of a book is one example. 
The suject and language indices often found at the end of a linguistics book are
also good examples of metadata. Both types of indices tell the user about
the internal content of that book.
</p>

<p align="justify">
While the basic idea behind metadata may be old, the rise of the internet
will allow it to become more useful than it ever has been since metadata will
be much more accessible than before--and if metadata is more accessible,
then linguistic resources of all kinds will also be more accessible.
In order for this to happen, however, researchers must become aware
of how to produce good metadata and how to use metadata produced by others.
</p>



<h2><a name="Whatcan"></a>3. What can be done with metadata</h2>

<p align="justify">
One of the most important uses for metadata is to locate a resource.
Thus, a book reference is designed to give enough information to allow
someone to find that book.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The other primary use of metadata is resource discovery--that is,
finding resources relevant to one's research but which one
is unaware of. The subject
index of a card catalog is a metadata collection which is good for such a
purpose. With the advent of new technologies, there are many more possibilities for
the discovery of resources than were previously available.
Online indexes of abstracts, like
LexisNexis, are well-known tools which makes use of metadata and new
technology to greatly enhance the researcher's ability to find relevant
resources. These tools are not yet perfect, by any means, but they
do represent a significant step forward in resource discovery.
</p>

<p align="justify">
One of the primary goals of the <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/">Open Language Archives Community</a>
(OLAC) is to help linguists create metadata and distribute it in order to assist in
the discovery and location specifically of linguistic resources.
The basic reason linguists should consider creating metadata for their resources
is to allow other researchers to locate those resources. Of course, this might
not confer direct benefit to the owner of the resource. However, as more
metadata becomes available, all linguists will ultimately benefit since it
will allow them to the find resources the need more easily.
</p>



<h2><a name="Whatcant"></a>4. What can't be done with metadata</h2>

<p align="justify">
It's important to realize that metadata is simply data about data and not
the data in and of itself. Thus, making metadata public is fairly safe--metadata
alone does not give people access to the data. A
book reference is not a book, and metadata about online data
is also not the online data itself.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The most useful metadata makes it clear how a resource, once discovered,
can be located and accessed. The owner of the resource gets to determine how
easy or difficult access should be. Obviously, it's not very useful to let
people access metadata for a document that no one will ever be allowed
to access. However, it's important to realize that making your metadata
publicly available in no way implies that the resource the metadata describes
is also publicly available.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Furthermore, the creator of the metadata gets to determine what information
will be included in publicly-accessible metadata. While organizations like
OLAC will typically have recommendations for what needs to be included in
the metadata for a resource, these recommendations can be overridden if
there are any concerns about making any information publicly available.
</p>


<h2><a name="Why"></a>5. Why should linguists create and distribute metadata</h2>

<p align="left">
There are a range of reasons to create and distribute metadata. Some of
them are listed below.
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Management of an archive</b>: Good metadata makes it much easier for
a researcher to manage and keep track of the resources in an archive. Large
archives almost always have internal metadata standards which are important
to their maintenace. Metadata is crucial for the maintenance of
any archive in the long term, since it is the best way to ensure that
a resource in an archive can be tracked down when someone other than the original
archivist needs to locate it.
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Increasing awareness of your resources</b>: Though not always desirable,
many researchers actively want academics and the general public to be aware of the
resources they maintain. Good metadata helps people find resources since it
creates an easy way for them to get basic information about them. Using
a standard metadata format (like the OLAC standard) is especially useful
in this area since search tools are being developed which make
direct use of these standards.
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Increasing the value of community-wide metadata resources</b>: Metadata
is one of those things that becomes more valuable as more of it is made
available. If every linguist creates metadata for their resources, then
we all benefit by being able to find the data we need for our research. So,
even if one of your priorities is not to ``advertise'' your resources,
unless you have a good reason to keep them unavailable, you should consider
making and distributing metadata about them so that other people
will know they are out there. While this may not confer a direct benefit
to you, the indirect benefits of being part of a community of researchers
where there is an expectation that metadata will be made available are
potentially enormous. Consider, for example, the possibilities of having
a linguist's ``Google'' where you could type in a language name and
be reasonably sure you've found the bulk of documentary work done
on that language.
</p>




<h2><a name="Creation"></a>6. Steps required for metadata creation</h2>

<p align="justify">
Most researchers are already fairly skilled at making metadata, even if
they are not skilled at making structured, machine-readable metadata. This simply
requires understanding the important parameters needed to describe a resource
and then recording those parameters in a standardized way. Creating a list of references
at the end of a book or article requires a basic knowledge of metadata.
Also, most well-managed archives have collected their metadata and stored
it in a structured way, most typically in a database.
</p>

<p align="justify">
One of the primary goals of OLAC is to create a standard way to document
linguistic resources to assist in their location and
discovery. Importantly, OLAC does not seek to dictate how linguists
must design their metadata. Rather, it seeks to build a community-driven
consensus about linguistic metadata. (An article giving an <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/docs/overview.html">overview
of OLAC</a> is available on the OLAC web site at <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/">http://www.language-archives.org</a>
as is an article describing the proposed <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/olacms.html">OLAC metadata set</a>.)

</p>

<p align="justify">
Also, even an OLAC-compliant archive can store its metadata in a
non-OLAC format. Such a resource would simply ``translate'' its metadata
into OLAC metadata in order to make it more widely available.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A more technical term for translating metadata from one format to another
is <i>mapping</i> and sometimes another term <i>crosswalking</i> is
also used for this. Many archives have either created non-OLAC metadata or will
have good reasons for wanting to do so. However, for the most part, mapping
their metadata to OLAC metadata will be fairly straightforward since OLAC
metadata uses very general descriptors like ``creator'', ``subject'', and ``format''.
Since OLAC metadata is specifically designed for linguistic resources, it also includes
a few descriptors like ``subject language'' which are of particular value to
language researchers.
</p>

<p align="justify">
An example will help to illustrate how mapping from a particular metadata format
to the OLAC standard could work. The record below is taken from the internal
metadata database for the <a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/CBOLD">Comparative Bantu Online Dictionary</a>.

<p align="justify">
This record contains a range of information, not all of which is likely to be of equal
importance to linguists for resource location and discovery.
The language, Gevove, is of obvious interest, and the name
of the creator of the data is also fairly important. Other parameters
like ``Recon Status'' (meaning how much lexical
reconstruction had been done on the resource) are likely to be less important for the
general researcher (though they may be of importance to a minority of them).
</p>

<p align="justify">
The information in the above metadata record was mapped to OLAC metadata
by the author of this article in the following way:
</p>

<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><b>Title</b></td> <td>Gevove.vdVeen1994</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Subject language</b></td> <td>Gevove</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Contributor</b></td> <td>Van Der Veen, Lolke</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Date</b></td> <td>2001-09-23</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Type</b></td> <td>dataset</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Formats</b></td> <td>Word 5, Text</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Identifier</b></td> <td>http://bantu.berkeley.edu/CBOLDFTP/CBOLD_Data/Gevove.vdVeen1994</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Language</b></td> <td>French</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Rights</b></td> <td>See: http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/CBOLD/Data/CBOLD.data.html</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p align="justify">
The first thing to note about the mapping from CBOLD internal metadata to
OLAC metadata is that information is lost--for example, there is no
mention of ``Recon status'' in the OLAC version. OLAC standard metadata
does not contain a ``Recon status'' field since this is too specific
for general language resources. Translating from a more specific metadata format
to a more general one often involves losing some information. This isn't
generally a problem unless it substantially hinders resource location and
discovery.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It would have been possible to include information like ``Recon status''
in the OLAC metadata because the OLAC standard is flexible. For
example, though it does not define a ``Recon status'' field, it does
define a <i>Description</i> field, where any information not belonging to
another field can be put.
</p>

<p align="justify">
If it is possible to put information like ``Recon status'' into OLAC metadata
via the <i>Description</i> field, why wasn't it done? As the creator of
the above metadata records, I can say that this was because because it made the task
of mapping simpler for me. I made sure the most important aspects
of the metadata (like subject language) appeared in OLAC metadata, of course,
but also chose to leave some information out.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This ``incomplete'' mapping of CBOLD-internal metadata to OLAC metadata illustrates
an important point: Ideal metadata would contain all information possible about a
resource. However, OLAC does not enforce this. Rather, it leaves it up to
the creator to decide what information to put in the metadata. OLAC standard metadata
must have a particular structure and make use of OLAC-defined descriptive
parameters, but the creator of the metadata otherwise has a lot of flexibility.
</p>

<p align="justify">
If there's one general piece of advice to give for making metadata, it is
to think of the needs of the potential end user of it. This can be difficult,
because it is hard to exactly who will need to use your resource. From the OLAC
perspective, though, it will usually be worthwhile to think about what
kinds of linguists might find yourself valuable and what sort of search
criteria would they be likely to use to locate it.
</p>



<h2><a name="Distribution"></a>7. How to distribute metadata</h2>

<p align="justify">
Many archives have already designed ways to distribute their metadata,
most typically through some sort of online access to their database.
The Linguistic Data Consortium, for example, has on <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/">online catalog</a>
to allow access to its metadata.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Online archive access managed by the archive is certainly very valuable,
but it has the problem that the user must know about the archive in the
first place in order to locate resources in that archive. Ideally, metadata
from all linguistic archives could be accessed and searched in a centralized
way so that a linguist need not know about a relevant archive in order
to locate useful resources--this requires a generalized system of
metadata distribution.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The OLAC metadata standard is specifically designed to make general distribution
of linguistic metadata possible. This metadata standard is the first step to the creation
of search engines designed specifically for the needs of language researchers. 
There are various ways to distribute OLAC metadata,
some of which are simpler than others. These ways are described in
the <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/tools/faq">Implementers FAQ</a> document.
<!--
The simplest way is to use the <a href="/docs/implement.html#ORE">OLAC Repository Editor</a>.
-->
</p>

<p align="justify">
Search engines making use of OLAC metadata already exist, the most important
being the one hosted by the <a href="http://linguistlist.org/">LINGUIST List</a>
at <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/olac/">http://www.linguistlist.org/olac/</a>.
The value of these search engines is largely contingent on the metadata
made available to them. The more researchers who create OLAC standard metadata,
the easier it will be for all researchers to find the data they need.
</p>


<h2><a name="Nextsteps"></a>8. Next steps and further resources</h2>

<p align="justify">
There are a number of resources on the web for anyone interested in
learning more about metadata. For linguists, the OLAC implementers
site is very useful.
</p>

<p align="left">
<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/docs/implement.html">http://www.language-archives.org/docs/implement.html</a>
</p>

<p align="left">
This site tells you how to become and OLAC data provider and gives various
menthods to do so.
</p>

<p align="left">
Another important set of documents can be found at:
</p>

<p align="left">
<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/documents.html">http://www.language-archives.org/documents.html</a>
</p>

<p align="left">
There, you can find documentation for the latest OLAC metadata 
standards. These are community-driven standards. So, comments and suggestions
for improving them can be made by anyone who intends on using the OLAC standards.
</p>

<p align="left">
The OLAC metadata standard is based on the metadata standards developed
by the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a>.
The Dublin Core standard is meant to describe all types of resources,
and the OLAC standard is an elaboration of the Dublin Core tailored for
language resources. The Dublin Core Usage Guide can be found at
</p>

<p align="left">
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/">http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/</a>
</p>

<p align="left">
This guide is a more technical introduction to metadata than the present
document but is still fairly accessible. In addition to basic information
on metadata, it outlines the basic rationale behind the Dublin Core and also
gives some examples about how metadata can actually be represented in
digital document--something which has not been discussed here.
</p>

<p align="left">
The standard language for encoding OLAC metadata is XML (Extensible
Markup Language). XML can be understood as a more generalized form
of HTML, the standard language used for web documents. The
<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines2/index.html">Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines</a>
contain a useful chapter introducing some of the basic concepts of
XML:
